# 100 Days of Python  

Welcome to the **100 Days of Python** challenge! This repository contains my journey of learning and practicing Python for 100 days. Each day, I work on a new project, concept, or coding exercise to improve my Python skills.  

## About the Challenge  
The **100 Days of Python** challenge is a commitment to coding every day to strengthen problem-solving skills and gain hands-on experience with Python. The challenge covers:  
- Python fundamentals  
- Data structures and algorithms  
- Web development with Django/Flask  
- Automation and web scraping  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)  
- Working with APIs  
- And much more!  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
Each day’s work is organized into separate folders:  

100_days_python/ 
    │── Day_01/ │ 
        ├── main.ipynb │
